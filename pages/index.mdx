Welcome to the home of my assorted thoughts and musings on software, data, and problem solving. I'm an engineer in Austin, TX, and I've spent my career building data platforms and infrastructure for startups in the area. In my free time I am a tabletop RPG player and game master, a 3D artist, and a lover of science fiction and fantasy stories.
